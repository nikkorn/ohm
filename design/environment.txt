- LAUNCH_PYLON:
    A tile which can be interacted with using the PULSE button. Holding PULSE while over this tile
    will suck the character into it. Releasing PULSE will launch the charater in the direction of the secondary analog.

- WEAK_BLOCK:
    A block which can be blown up by either a special enemy possesion or by throwing a bomb at it.

- DOOR:
    A block which corresponds with an enemy in the area. Killing this enemy will open the door. Maybe signified by colour? 

- WIRE:
    Some blocks will be entry points for wire circuits which can be travelled using PULSE. These circuits can change, maybe with spinning tiles?
